# Voronoi diagrams and Folium

In mathematics, a [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is dual to its [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation).
